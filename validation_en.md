## Interactive validation
 
Since 2017, the Danish Fungal Atlas has had interactive validation of fungal records. When a user submits a record, a probability score is calculated for the accuracy of the identification. This score ranges from 1 to 100. The calculation includes:

1. The rarity of the species (# approved records)
2. The geographical distribution of the species
3. Phenology of the species (e.g. many mycorrhizal fungi have a low probability score in spring)
4. Userâ€™s previous approved identifications of the same species
5. Nr. of species within the morphological group the user has correctly identified in the past
6. Confidence indicated by the user: Certain: 100%, Probable: 50%, Possible: 10%

Subsequently, other users may agree on the identification, increasing the identification score in accordance with the principles 4-6, or propose alternative identifications. The identification with the highest score is highlighted, alternative identifications and their scores are also visible to logged-in users. In the search results, the probability score is displayed in three general categories:

1. Approved (score above 80) with 3 stars
2. Likely (score between 50 and 80) with 2 stars
3. Suggestion (score below 50) with 1 star

## Expert validation

A group of taxonomic experts (validators) are monitoring data the Danish Mushroom Atlas. These have the power to approve findings regardless of the score in the interactive validation. This can be relevant for discoveries of new species, for very rare species and for records of species where special experience or sequencing of genetic material (DNA) is required for a safe identification. Expert-validated findings are marked with a small microscope icon.
